# Get Started

## Quick Start with Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by clicking the link:

[![](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Markdown%20powered%20docs%20site.%20Built%20with%20Next.js.&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2Fdemo.png&demo-title=Documentation%20Starter%20Kit&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2F&project-name=nextjs-docs&repository-name=nextjs-docs&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra&from=templates)

Vercel will create the Nextra repository and deploy the site for you with just a few clicks.
Once done, every change in the repository will be deployed automatically.

## Create Manually

Nextra works like a Next.js plugin, and it accepts a theme config (layout) to render the page. To start:

1. Install Next.js, Nextra and React: `yarn add next nextra react react-dom`

2. Install the docs theme (you can use any theme you like): `yarn add nextra-theme-docs`

3. Create the following Next.js config:

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
import nextra from 'nextra'

const withNextra = nextra({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx'
  // optional: add `staticImage: true` to enable Nextra's auto image import
})
export default withNextra()
```

4. Create a `theme.config.jsx` file for the docs theme:

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
  projectLink: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra', // GitHub link in the navbar
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/master', // base URL for the docs repository
  nextLinks: true,
  prevLinks: true,
  search: true,
  customSearch: null, // customizable, you can use algolia for example
  darkMode: true,
  footer: true,
  footerText: `MIT ${new Date().getFullYear()} © Shu Ding.`,
  footerEditLink: `Edit this page on GitHub`,
  logo: (
    <>
      <svg>...</svg>
      <span>Next.js Static Site Generator</span>
    </>
  ),
  head: (
    <>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <meta name="description" content="Nextra: the next docs builder" />
      <meta name="og:title" content="Nextra: the next docs builder" />
    </>
  )
}
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  More configuration options for the docs theme can be found
  [here](/themes/docs/configuration).
</Callout>

5. Create `pages/_app.jsx` and include the theme stylesheet:

```jsx filename="_app.jsx"
import 'nextra-theme-docs/style.css'

export default function Nextra({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

6. You are good to go! Run `yarn next` to start.

---

<span id="sidebar-and-anchor-links" />
<Callout>
  Any `.md` or `.mdx` file will turn into a doc page and be displayed in
  sidebar. You can also create a `meta.json` file to customize the page order
  and title. <br /> Check the source code: https://github.com/shuding/nextra for
  more information.
</Callout>

<Callout>
You can also use [`<style jsx>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js) to style elements inside `theme.config.jsx`.
</Callout>


# Introduction

**Nextra** is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused
websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create
Markdown-based content with ease.

## Quick Start

import { Cards } from 'nextra/components'

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    image
    arrow
    title="Documentation theme"
    href="/docs/docs-theme/start"
  >
    <>![Documentation theme](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card image arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>

If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow
the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.

## Nextra FAQ

The Nextra FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the
project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please
[open a discussion](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions).

export function FAQBox({ title, children }) {
  return (
    <details
      open
      className="last-of-type:mb-0 rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2 mt-4"
    >
      <summary>
        <strong className="text-lg">{title}</strong>
      </summary>
      <div className="p-2">{children}</div>
    </details>
  )
}

<FAQBox title="Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?">
  No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for
  the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and
  `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other
  routes in `/app`
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?">
  There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
  [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
  add live coding components to your MDX.
